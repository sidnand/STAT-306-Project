# The Relation Between Credit Limits, Income

We will use the “Predicting Credit Card Customer Segmentation” dataset from
Kaggle. The information was gathered in six months and consists of 10,000 records and 23
columns. The dataset contains records for each client, each of which contains details about
the customer's age, gender, marital status, level of education, income, and credit limit.
Additionally, the dataset contains details about how the customer uses their credit card,
including their average monthly cost, the number of transactions they make each month,
and the length of time they have been customers.
